Rise is a framework for games, it contains all of the components I could ever need to build an RPG. 
It is based on some of the features in the Creation kit and also RPGs that I have played and enjoyed in the past.
It is built to be a kitchen sink framework, meaning it should contain literally everything.

## Install dependencies

All dependencies are installed with npm, you can get all of the project dependencies by running:

```
npm install
```

## Running tests

This app uses Jest to run tests against its features, it also has prettier to ensure everything looks the same.
To run Jest and prettier, run this command from your terminal:

```
npm t
```
